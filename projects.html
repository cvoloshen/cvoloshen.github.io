                    <p>Degenerative disc disease (DDD) remains a significant challenge in spinal healthcare, with tissue-engineered artificial discs offering a promising treatment approach. However, a critical limitation of current solutions is the inability to maintain the placement of these discs within the intervertebral space long enough for full biological integration.</p>
                    <p>To address this issue, I am working as part of a multidisciplinary design team to develop a biodegradable fixation cage that stabilizes the tissue-engineered disc while preserving the natural biomechanics of the spine. My role in this project involves designing and implementing a testing apparatus and experimental protocol to verify and validate the effectiveness of our cage design. This work integrates key engineering skills, including 3D CAD design, 3D printing, and robotics programming, to ensure the success of the proposed solution.</p>

                    <p>I am currently developing an autonomous robotic platform capable of performing advanced computer vision tasks, including object detection, tracking, and navigation. This project involves practical experience in programming microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi Pico W) and embedded systems (Raspberry Pi Zero), system integration, and problem-solving through the implementation of the Sparkfun XRP robotic platform.</p>
                    <p>The project explores key aspects of cyber-physical system architectures, computational and embedded systems, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, it involves applying various computer programming languages and paradigms, integrating wired and wireless communication protocols, and working with sensors, actuators, and sensor networks. Signal processing and computer vision techniques are also fundamental to the system's functionality, enabling the robot to interpret and respond to its environment effectively.</p>

                    <p>In my undergraduate lab, I worked on improving both the speed and quality of ultrasound image reconstruction by optimizing and designing algorithms in MATLAB. A key aspect of this work involved developing an approach to incorporate a sound speed map into the reconstruction process. By accounting for variations in sound speed, this method provided a more accurate estimate of where transducer-received signals originated, ultimately refining image quality.</p>
                    <p>This project required expertise in signal processing, algorithm development, and computational optimization to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of ultrasound imaging. My contributions helped advance real-time imaging capabilities, improving the potential for more precise diagnostic applications.</p>
